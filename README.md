Client setup:

In the terminal, run the command 'npm install' to install necessary dependencies.

Once the packages finish installing run the command, 'npm start'.

This should open your browser and direct you to 'localhost:3000'.

If running npm start does not open your browser and go to the site automatically, enter the url: 'localhost:3000'.

The client end should now be operational. 

Server:

Refer to the repository 'Student-Registry-server' for instructions on setting up the back-end of the app.

Using the app:

Enter any characters in the 'Name', 'Grade' and 'Section' fields. The 'Registration No.' field requires a numeric value.

Click 'CREATE' when you are ready to add a student to the registry.

If you'd like to delete a student from the registry, click the trashcan icon under 'Action' to remove them.
